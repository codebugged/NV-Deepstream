We are running the Jetson Nano Developer Kit in a "headless" configuration. 
That means you do not hook up a monitor directly to the Jetson Nano Developer Kit. This method conserves memory resources on the Jetson Nano and has the added benefit of eliminating the requirement for extra hardware, i.e. a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

In addition, we will further simplify the configuration by using "USB Device Mode". In this mode, your Jetson Nano Developer Kit connects directly to your computer through a USB cable. This eliminates the need for a network connection on the Jetson Nano, as well as the need to determine the IP address on your network. It is always 192.168.55.1:8888 in this mode.

What is Deep Stream Application ?
DeepStream applications introduce deep neural networks and other complex processing tasks into a stream processing pipeline to enable near real-time analytics on video and other sensor data.
